<h4>Type: Data</h4>
<p>The MEMBER_TYPE rule accepts a YYYY-MM-DD formatted date and returns a string describing the highest membership in effect for the player on that date. It can also accept date ranges in three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD: Looks for the highest membership in effect at any time between the dates specified (inclusive)</li>
<li>&lt;YYYY-MM-DD: Looks for the highest membership in effect at any time up to and including the date specified (equivalent to 0000-00-00,YYYY-MM-DD)</li>
<li>&gt;YYYY-MM-DD: Looks for the highest membership in effect at any time starting from the date specified (equivalent to YYYY-MM-DD,9999-12-31)</li>
</ul>
<p>The date specification must be enclosed in quotes.</p>
<p>Currently, the possible member types are "none" (they do not have a membership in effect on the given date), "intro" or "full". The membership type and valid dates are determined from the configuration of the membership events that the player has registered <strong>and paid</strong> for.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>MEMBER_TYPE('<?php echo $year; ?>-06-01')</pre>
<p>would return one of <strong>none</strong>, <strong>intro</strong> or <strong>full</strong>, depending on the membership registration spanning June 1 of this year (if any) found in the player's history.</p>
<pre>MEMBER_TYPE('&lt;<?php echo $year; ?>-06-01')</pre>
<p>would return one of <strong>none</strong>, <strong>intro</strong> or <strong>full</strong>, depending on the membership registrations up to and including June 1 of this year (if any) found in the player's history.</p>
<pre>MEMBER_TYPE('<?php echo $year-5; ?>-06-01,<?php echo $year; ?>-06-01')</pre>
<p>would return one of <strong>none</strong>, <strong>intro</strong> or <strong>full</strong>, depending on the membership registrations covering the 5 years up to and including June 1 of this year (if any) found in the player's history.</p>
