<p>The manual calculator is intended for use solely with "competition" divisions.</p>
<p>It is unclear at the time of writing what options may need to be supported for entry, comparison and ranking, so for now the game rating must be manually calculated and entered as the score.</p>
<p class="warning-message">Note that low ratings are considered better; for example, enter "1" for the team that finished first, "2" for the team that finished second, etc.</p>
