Dear <?php echo $captains; ?>,

<?php echo $person['full_name']; ?> has indicated that <?php
echo ($person['gender'] == 'Male' ? 'he' : 'she'); ?> will be <?php
echo Configure::read("event_attendance_verb.$status");
?> the <?php echo $team['name']; ?> event "<?php echo $event['TeamEvent']['name'];
?>" at <?php echo $event['TeamEvent']['location_name'] .
" ({$event['TeamEvent']['location_street']}, {$event['TeamEvent']['location_city']}, {$event['TeamEvent']['location_province']})";
?> starting at <?php echo $this->ZuluruTime->time($event['TeamEvent']['start']);
?> on <?php
echo $this->ZuluruTime->date($event['TeamEvent']['date']);
?>.

<?php if (!empty($comment)): ?>
<?php echo $comment; ?>


<?php endif; ?>
<?php if ($status == ATTENDANCE_AVAILABLE): ?>
If you want <?php echo $person['first_name']; ?> to attend this event:
<?php
echo Router::url(array('controller' => 'team_events', 'action' => 'attendance_change', 'event' => $event['TeamEvent']['id'], 'person' => $person['id'], 'code' => $code, 'status' => ATTENDANCE_ATTENDING), true);
?>


If you know <b>for sure</b> that you don't want <?php echo $person['first_name']; ?> to attend this event:
<?php
echo Router::url(array('controller' => 'team_events', 'action' => 'attendance_change', 'event' => $event['TeamEvent']['id'], 'person' => $person['id'], 'code' => $code, 'status' => ATTENDANCE_ABSENT), true);
?>


Either of these actions will generate an automatic email to <?php echo $person['first_name']; ?> indicating your selection. If you are unsure whether you will want <?php echo $person['first_name']; ?> to attend this event, it's best to leave <?php echo ($person['gender'] == 'Male' ? 'him' : 'her'); ?> listed as available, and take action later when you know for sure. You can always update <?php echo ($person['gender'] == 'Male' ? 'his' : 'her'); ?> status on the web site, there is no need to keep this email for that purpose.

<?php endif; ?>
<?php echo $this->element('email/text/footer'); ?>
